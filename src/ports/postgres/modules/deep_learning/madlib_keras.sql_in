This module allows you to use SQL to call deep learning
models designed in Keras [1], which is a high-level neural
network API written in Python.

Keras can run on top of different backends and the one that is currently
supported by MADlib is TensorFlow [2].  The implementation
in MADlib is designed to train
a single model across multiple segments (workers)
in Greenplum database.  (PostgreSQL is also supported.)
Alternatively, to train multiple models at the same time for model
architecture search or hyperparameter tuning, you can
use the methods in <a href="group__grp__model__selection.html">Train Multiple Models</a>.

The main use case supported is classification
using sequential models, which are made up of a
linear stack of layers.  This includes multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)
and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  Regression is not
currently supported.

Before using Keras in MADlib you will need to preprocess
your training and evaluation datasets by using the method called
<a href="group__grp__input__preprocessor__dl.html">Preprocess
Data</a> which is a utility that prepares data for
use by models that support mini-batch as an optimization option.
This is a one-time operation and you would only
need to re-run the preprocessor if your input data has changed.
The advantage of using mini-batching is that it
can perform better than stochastic gradient descent
because it uses more than one training example at a time,
typically resulting faster and smoother convergence [3].

You can also do inference on models that have not been trained in MADlib,
but rather imported from an external source.  This is described in the section
called "Predict BYOM" below, where "BYOM" stands for "Bring Your Own Model."

Note that the following MADlib functions are targeting a specific TensorFlow
kernel version (1.14). Using a newer or older version may or may not work as intended.

MADlib's deep learning methods are designed to use the TensorFlow package and its built in Keras
functions.  To ensure consistency, please use tensorflow.keras objects (models, layers, etc.)
instead of importing Keras and using its objects.

@note CUDA GPU memory cannot be released until the process holding it is terminated.
When a MADlib deep learning function is called with GPUs, Greenplum internally
creates a process (called a slice) which calls TensorFlow to do the computation.
This process holds the GPU memory until one of the following two things happen:
query finishes and user logs out of the Postgres client/session; or,
query finishes and user waits for the timeout set by gp_vmem_idle_resource_timeout.
The default value for this timeout is 18 sec [8].  So the recommendation is:
log out/reconnect to the session after every GPU query; or
wait for gp_vmem_idle_resource_timeout before you run another GPU query (you can
also set it to a lower value).

@anchor keras_fit
@par Fit
The fit (training) function has the following format:

<pre class="syntax">
madlib_keras_fit(
    source_table,
    model,
    model_arch_table,
    model_id,
    compile_params,
    fit_params,
    num_iterations,
    use_gpus,
    validation_table,
    metrics_compute_frequency,
    warm_start,
    name,
    description,
    object_table
    )
</pre>

\b Arguments
<dl class="arglist">
  <dt>source_table</dt>
  <dd>TEXT. Name of the table containing the training data.
  This is the name of the output
  table from the data preprocessor.  Independent
  and dependent variables are specified in the preprocessor
  step which is why you do not need to explictly state
  them here as part of the fit function.</dd>

  <dt>model</dt>
  <dd>TEXT. Name of the output table containing the model.
  Details of the output table are shown below.
  </dd>

  <dt>model_arch_table</dt>
  <dd>TEXT. Name of the table containing the model
  architecture and (optionally) initial weights to use for
  training.
  </dd>

  <dt>model_id</dt>
  <dd>INTEGER. This is the id in 'model_arch_table'
  containing the model architecture and (optionally)
  initial weights to use for training.
  </dd>

  <DT>compile_params</DT>
  <DD>TEXT.
    Parameters passed to the compile method of the Keras
    model class [4].  These parameters will be passed through as is
    so they must conform to the Keras API definition.
    As an example, you might use something like: <em>loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['acc']</em>.
    The mandatory parameters that must be specified are 'optimizer'
    and 'loss'.  Others are optional and will use the default
    values as per Keras if not specified here.  Also, when
    specifying 'loss' and 'metrics' do <em>not</em> include the
    module and submodule prefixes
    like <em>loss='losses.categorical_crossentropy'</em>
    or <em>optimizer='keras.optmizers.adam'</em>.

    @note
    - Custom loss functions and custom metrics can be used as defined in
    <a href="group__grp__custom__function.html">Define Custom Functions.</a>
    List the custom function name and provide the name of the table where the
    serialized Python objects reside using the parameter 'object_table' below.
    - The following loss function is
    not supported: <em>sparse_categorical_crossentropy</em>.
    The following metrics are not
    supported: <em>sparse_categorical_accuracy, sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy</em>.
    - The Keras accuracy parameter <em>top_k_categorical_accuracy</em> returns top 5 accuracy by
    default.  If you want a different top k value, use the helper function
    <a href="group__grp__custom__function.html#top_k_function">Top k Accuracy Function</a>
    to create a custom
    Python function to compute the top k accuracy that you want.

  </DD>

  <DT>fit_params </DT>
  <DD>TEXT.  Parameters passed to the fit method of the Keras
    model class [4].  These will be passed through as is
    so they must conform to the Keras API definition.
    As an example, you might use something like:
    <em>batch_size=128, epochs=4</em>.
    There are no mandatory parameters so
    if you specify NULL, it will use all default
    values as per Keras.

    @note
    Callbacks are not currently supported except for TensorBoard
    which you can specify in the usual way,
    e.g., callbacks=[TensorBoard(log_dir="/tmp/logs/fit")]
  </DD>

  <DT>num_iterations</DT>
  <DD>INTEGER.  Number of iterations to train.
  </DD>

  <DT>use_gpus (optional)</DT>
  <DD>BOOLEAN, default: FALSE (i.e., CPU). Determines whether GPUs
  are to be used for training the neural network.  Set to TRUE to use GPUs.

    @note
    This parameter must not conflict with how the distribution rules are set in
    the preprocessor function.  For example, if you set a distribution rule to use
    certain segments on hosts that do not have GPUs attached, you will get an error
    if you set ‘use_gpus’ to TRUE.  Also, we have seen some memory related issues
    when segments share GPU resources.
    For example, if you have 1 GPU per segment host and your cluster has 4
    segments per segment host, it means that all 4
    segments will share the same
    GPU on each host. The current recommended
    configuration is 1 GPU per segment.
  </DD>

  <dt>validation_table (optional)</dt>
  <dd>TEXT, default: none. Name of the table containing
  the validation dataset.
  Note that the validation dataset must be preprocessed
  in the same way as the training dataset, so this
  is the name of the output
  table from running the data preprocessor on the validation dataset.
  Using a validation dataset can mean a
  longer training time, depending on its size.
  This can be controlled using the 'metrics_compute_frequency'
  paremeter described below.</dd>

  <DT>metrics_compute_frequency (optional)</DT>
  <DD>INTEGER, default: once at the end of training
  after 'num_iterations'.  Frequency to compute per-iteration
  metrics for the training dataset and validation dataset
  (if specified).  There can be considerable cost to
  computing metrics every iteration, especially if the
  training dataset is large.  This parameter is a way of
  controlling the frequency of those computations.
  For example, if you specify 5, then metrics will be computed
  every 5 iterations as well as at the end of training
  after 'num_iterations'.  If you use the default,
  metrics will be computed only
  once after 'num_iterations' have completed.
  </DD>

  <DT>warm_start (optional)</DT>
  <DD>BOOLEAN, default: FALSE.
    Initalize weights with the coefficients
    from the last call of the fit
    function. If set to TRUE, weights will be
    initialized from the model table
    generated by the previous training run.

    @note
    The warm start feature works based on the name of the
    model output table from a previous training run.
    When using warm start, do not drop the model output table
    or the model output summary table
    before calling the fit function, since these are needed to obtain the
    weights from the previous run.
    If you are not using warm start, the model output table
    and the model output table summary must be dropped in
    the usual way before calling the training function.
  </DD>

  <DT>name (optional)</DT>
  <DD>TEXT, default: NULL.
    Free text string to identify a name, if desired.
  </DD>

  <DT>description (optional)</DT>
  <DD>TEXT, default: NULL.
    Free text string to provide a description, if desired.
  </DD>

  <DT>object_table (optional)</DT>
  <DD>TEXT, default: NULL.
    Name of the table that contains the custom functions. Note that this table
    must be created using the <a href="group__grp__custom__function.html">Define Custom Functions</a> method. Do not
    qualify with a schema name, since schema will be automatically pulled from
    the function definition.
  </DD>

    The number of GPUs to use is determined by the parameters
    passed to the preprocessor.

    @note
    We have seen some memory related issues when segments
    share GPU resources.
    For example, if you provide 1 GPU and your
    database cluster is set up to have 4
    segments per segment host, it means that all 4
    segments on a segment host will share the same
    GPU. The current recommended
    configuration is 1 GPU per segment.

@anchor keras_predict_byom
@par Predict BYOM (bring your own model)
The predict BYOM function allows you to do inference on models that
have not been trained on MADlib, but rather imported from elsewhere.
It has the following format:
<pre class="syntax">
madlib_keras_predict_byom(
    model_arch_table,
    model_id,
    test_table,
    id_col,
    independent_varname,
    output_table,
    pred_type,
    use_gpus,
    class_values,
    normalizing_const,
    dependent_count
    )
</pre>


\b Arguments
<dl class="arglist">

<DT>model_arch_table</DT>
  <DD>TEXT. Name of the architecture table containing the model
  to use for prediction. The model weights and architecture can be loaded to
  this table by using the
  <a href="group__grp__keras__model__arch.html">Define Model Architectures</a> function.
  </DD>

  <DT>model_id</DT>
  <DD>INTEGER. This is the id in 'model_arch_table' containing the model
  architecture and model weights to use for prediction.
  </DD>

  <DT>test_table</DT>
  <DD>TEXT. Name of the table containing the dataset to
  predict on.  Note that test data is not preprocessed (unlike
  fit and evaluate) so put one test image per row for prediction.
  Set the 'normalizing_const' below for the independent variable if necessary.
  </DD>

  <DT>id_col</DT>
  <DD>TEXT. Name of the id column in the test data table.
  </DD>

  <DT>independent_varname</DT>
  <DD>TEXT. Column with independent variables in the test table.
  Set the 'normalizing_const' below if necessary.
  </DD>

  <DT>output_table</DT>
  <DD>TEXT. Name of the table that prediction output will be
  written to. Table contains:</DD>
    <table class="output">
      <tr>
        <th>id</th>
        <td>Gives the 'id' for each prediction, corresponding to each row from
        the test_table.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>class_name</th>
        <td>
        The estimated variable.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>class_value</th>
        <td>
        The estimated class for classification.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>prob</th>
        <td>
        Probability of a given class.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>rank</th>
        <td>
        The rank of a given class based on the ordering of probabilities.
        </td>
      </tr>

  <DT>pred_type (optional)</DT>
  <DD>TEXT, default: 'response'. The type of output desired, where 'response'
   gives the actual prediction and 'prob' gives the probability value for each class.
  </DD>

  <DT>use_gpus (optional)</DT>
  <DD>BOOLEAN, default: FALSE (i.e., CPU).
    Flag to enable GPU support for training neural network.
    The number of GPUs to use is determined by the parameters
    passed to the preprocessor.

    @note
    We have seen some memory related issues when segments
    share GPU resources.
    For example, if you provide 1 GPU and your
    database cluster is set up to have 4
    segments per segment host, it means that all 4
    segments on a segment host will share the same
    GPU. The current recommended
    configuration is 1 GPU per segment.
  </DD>

  <DT>class_values (optional)</DT>
  <DD>TEXT[], default: NULL.
    Two dimensional list of class labels that were used while training the model
    for each dependent variable.

    @note
    If you specify the class values parameter,
    it must reflect how the dependent variable was 1-hot encoded for training.
    If you accidently pick another order that does not match the 1-hot encoding,
    the predictions would be wrong.
  </DD>

  <DT>normalizing_const (optional)</DT>
  <DD>DOUBLE PRECISION, default: 1.0.
  The normalizing constant to divide each value in the 'independent_varname'
  array by. For example, you would use 255 for this value if the image data is
  in the form 0-255.
  </DD>

  <DT>dependent_count (optional)</DT>
  <DD>INTEGER, default: 1.
  The number of dependent variables in the model.
  </DD>
</DL>

@note
Deep learning works best on very large datasets,
but that is not convenient for a quick introduction
to the syntax. So in this example we use an MLP on the well
known iris data set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris.
For more realistic examples with images please refer
to the deep learning notebooks
at https://github.com/apache/madlib-site/tree/asf-site/community-artifacts.

-# Predict BYOM.
We will use the validation dataset for prediction
as well, which is not usual but serves to show the
syntax. See <a href="group__grp__keras__model__arch.html">Define Model Architectures</a>
for details on how to load the model architecture and weights.
In this example we will use weights we already have:
<pre class="example">
UPDATE model_arch_library
SET model_weights = iris_model.model_weights
FROM iris_model
WHERE model_arch_library.model_id = 1;
</pre>
Now train using a model from the model architecture table directly
without referencing the model table from the MADlib training.  Note that if you
specify the class values parameter as we do below, it must reflect how the dependent
variable was 1-hot encoded for training. In this example the 'training_preprocessor_dl()'
in Step 2 above encoded in the order {'Iris-setosa', 'Iris-versicolor', 'Iris-virginica'} so
this is the order we pass in the parameter. If we accidently pick another order that does
not match the 1-hot encoding, the predictions would be wrong.

<h4>Transfer Learning</h4>
Here we want
to start with initial weights from a pre-trained model
rather than training from scratch. We also want to use
a model architecture with the earlier feature layer(s)
frozen to save on training time. The example below is
somewhat contrived but gives you the idea of the steps.

-# Define and load a model architecture with
the 1st hidden layer frozen:

<pre class="example">
model_transfer = Sequential()
model_transfer.add(Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,), trainable=False))
model_transfer.add(Dense(10, activation='relu'))
model_transfer.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
model_simple.summary()
\verbatim

@par Notes

1. Refer to the deep learning section of the Apache MADlib
wiki [5] for important information including supported libraries
and versions.

2. Classification is currently supported, not regression.

3. Reminder about the distinction between warm start and transfer learning.  Warm start uses model
state (weights) from the model output table from a previous training run -
set the 'warm_start' parameter to TRUE in the fit function.
Transfer learning uses initial model state (weights) stored in the 'model_arch_table' - in this case set the
'warm_start' parameter to FALSE in the fit function.

@par Technical Background

For an introduction to deep learning foundations, including MLP and CNN,
refer to [6].

This module trains a single large model across the database cluster
using the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) approach, with model averaging [7].

On the effect of database cluster size: as the database cluster size increases, the per iteration
loss will be higher since the model only sees 1/n of the data, where n is the number of segments.
However, each iteration runs faster than single node because it is only traversing 1/n of the data.
For highly non-convex solution spaces, convergence behavior may diminish as cluster size increases.
Ensure that each segment has sufficient volume of data and examples of each class value.

Alternatively, to train multiple models at the same time for model
architecture search or hyperparameter tuning, you can
use the methods in <a href="group__grp__model__selection.html">Train Multiple Models</a>,
which does not do model averaging and hence may have better covergence efficiency.

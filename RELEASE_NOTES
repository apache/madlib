--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MADlib v1.7

Release Date: 2014-December-31

New features:
* Generalized Linear Model:
    - Added a new generic module for GLM functions that allow for response
    variables that have arbitrary distributions (rather than simply
    Gaussian distributions), and for an arbitrary function of the response
    variable (the link function) to vary linearly with the predicted values
    (rather than assuming that the response itself must vary linearly).
    - Available distribution families: gaussian (link functions: identity,
    inverse and log), binomial (link functions: probit and logit),
    poisson (link functions: log, identity and square-root), gamma (link
    functions: inverse, identity and log) and inverse gaussian (link functions:
    square-inverse, inverse, identity and log).
    - Deprecated 'mlogregr_train' in favor of 'multinom' available as part of
    the new GLM functionality.
    - Added a new 'ordinal' function for ordered logit and probit regression.

multi-node system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MADlib v1.6

Release Date: 2014-June-30

New features:
- Added a new unified 'margins' function that computes marginal effects for
linear, logistic, multilogistic, and cox proportional hazards regression. The
new function also introduces support for interaction terms in the independent
array.
- Updated convergence for 'elastic_net_train' by checking the change in the
loglikelihood instead of the l2-norm of the change in coefficients. This allows
for faster convergence in problems with multiple optimal solutions.
The default threshold for convergence has been reduced from 1e-4 to 1e-6.
- Added a new helper function to convert categorical variables to indicator
variables which can be used directly in regression methods. The function
currently only supports dummy encoding.
- Improved performance for cox proportional hazards: average improvement of
20 fold on GPDB and 2.5 fold on HAWQ.
- Improved performance on ARIMA by 30%.
- Added new functionality to export linear and logistic regression models as a
PMML object. The new module relies on PyXB to create PMML elements.
- Added a function ('array_scalar_add') to 'add' a scalar to an array.
- Added 'numeric' type support for all functions that take 'anyarray' as
argument.
- Made usability and aesthetic enhancements to documentation.

Bug Fixes:
- Prepended python module name to sys.path before executing madlib function
to avoid conflicts with user-defined modules.
- Added a check in K-Means to ensure dimensionality of all data points are
the same and also equal to the dimensionality of any provided initial centroids
(MADLIB-713, MADLIB-789).
- Added a check in multinomial regression to quit early and cleanly if model
size is greater than the maximum permissible memory (MADLIB-667).
- Fixed a minor bug with incorrect column names in the decision trees module
(MADLIB-763).
- Fixed a bug in Kmeans that resulted in incorrect number of centroids for
particular datasets (MADLIB-857).
- Fixed bug when grouping columns have same name as one of the output table
column names (MADLIB-833).

Deprecated Functions:
- Modules profile and quantile have been deprecated in favor of the 'summary'
function.
- Module 'svd_mf' has been deprecated in favor of the improved 'svd' function.
- Functions 'margins_logregr' and 'margins_mlogregr' have been deprecated in
favor of the 'margins' function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MADlib v1.5

Release Date: 2014-Mar-05

New features:
- Added a new port 'HAWQ'. MADlib can now be used with the Pivotal
Distribution of Hadoop (PHD) through HAWQ
(see http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/pivotal-hd for more details).
- Implemented performance improvements for linear and logistic predict functions.
- Moved Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) out of early stage development, and
updated the design and APIs for to enable ease of use and better functionality.
API changes include lincrf replaced by lincrf_train, crf_train_fgen and
crf_test_fgen with updated arguments, and format of segment tables.
- Improved linear support vector machines (SVMs) by enabling iterations, and
removed lsvm_predict and svm_predict, which are not useful in GPDB and HAWQ.
- Added new functions, with improved performance compared to svec_sfv, for
document vectorization into sparse vectors.
- Removed the bool-to-text cast and updated all functions depending on it to
explicitly convert variable to text.
- Added function properties for all SQL functions to allow the database optimizer
to make better plans.

Bug Fixes:
- Set client_min_messages to 'notice' during database installation to ensure
that log messages don't get logged to STDERR.
- Fixed elastic net prediction to predict using all features instead of just
the selected features to avoid an error when no feature is selected as relevant
in the trained model.
- For corner probability values, p=0 and p=1, in bernoulli and binomial
distributions, the quantile values should be 0 and num_of_trials (=1 in the case
of bernoulli) respectively, independent of the probability of success.
- Changed install script to explicitly use /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh to avoid
problems in Ubuntu where /bin/sh is linked to 'dash'.
- Fixed issue in Elastic Net to take any array expression as input instead of
specifically expecting the expression 'ARRAY[...]'.
- Fixed wrong output in percentile of count-min (CM) sketches.

Known issues:
- Elastic net prediction wrapper function elastic_net_prediction is not
available in HAWQ. Instead, prediction functionality is available for both
families via elastic_net_gaussian_predict and elastic_net_binomial_predict.
- Distance metrics functions in K-Means for the HAWQ port are restricted to the
in-built functions, specifically squaredDistNorm2, distNorm2, distNorm1,
distAngle, and distTanimoto.
- Functions in Quantile and Profile modules of Early Stage Development are not
available in HAWQ. Replacement of these functions is available as built-in
functions (percentile_cont) in HAWQ and Summary module in MADlib, respectively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MADlib v1.4.1

Release Date: 2013-Dec-13

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed problem in Elastic Net for 'binomial' family if an 'integer' column was
passed for dependent variable instead of a 'boolean' column.
- '*' support in Elastic Net lacked checks for the columns being combined. Now
we check if the column for '*' is already an array, in which case we don't wrap
it with an 'array' modifier. If there are multiple columns we check that they
are of the same numeric type before building an array.
- Fixed a software regression in Robust Variance, Clustered Variance and
Marginal Effects for multinomial regression introduced in v1.4 when
output table name is schema-qualified.
- We now also support schema-qualified output table prefixes for SVD and PCA.
- Added warning message when deprecated functions are run. Also added a list of
deprecated functions in the ReadMe.
- Added a Markdown Readme along with the text version for better rendering on
Github.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MADlib v1.4

Release Date: 2013-Nov-25

New Features:
* Improved interface for Multinomial logistic regression:
    - Added a new interface that accepts an 'output_table' parameter and
    stores the model details in the output table instead of returning as a struct
    data type. The updated function also builds a summary table that includes
    all parameters and meta-parameters used during model training.
    - The output table has been reformatted to present the model coefficients
    and related metrics for each category in a separate row. This replaces the
    old output format of model stats for all categories combined in a
    single array.
* Variance Estimators
    - Added Robust Variance estimator for Cox PH models (Lin and Wei, 1989).
    It is useful in calculating variances in a dataset with potentially
    noisy outliers. Namely, the standard errors are asymptotically normal even
    if the model is wrong due to outliers.
    - Added Clustered Variance estimator for Cox PH models. It is used
    when data contains extra clustering information besides covariates and
    are asymptotically normal estimates.
* NULL Handling:
    - Modified behavior of regression modules to 'omit' rows containing NULL
    values for any of the dependent and independent variables. The number of
    rows skipped is provided as part of the output table.
    This release includes NULL handling for following modules:
        - Linear, Logistic, and Multinomial logistic regression, as well as
        Cox Proportional Hazards
        - Huber-White sandwich estimators for linear, logistic, and multinomial
        logistic regression as well as Cox Proportional Hazards
        - Clustered variance estimators for linear, logistic, and multinomial
        logistic regression as well as Cox Proportional Hazards
        - Marginal effects for logistic and multinomial logistic regression

Deprecated functions:
    - Multinomial logistic regression function has been renamed to
    'mlogregr_train'. Old function ('mlogregr') has been deprecated,
    and will be removed in the next major version update.

    - For all multinomial regression estimator functions (list given below),
    changes in the argument list were made to collate all optimizer specific
    arguments in a single string. An example of the new optimizer parameter is
    'max_iter=20, optimizer=irls, precision=0.0001'.
    This is in contrast to the original argument list that contained 3 arguments:
    'max_iter', 'optimizer', and 'precision'. This change allows adding new
    optimizer-specific parameters without changing the argument list.
    Affected functions:
        - robust_variance_mlogregr
        - clustered_variance_mlogregr
        - margins_mlogregr

Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed an overflow problem in LDA by using INT64 instead of INT32.
    - Fixed integer to boolean cast bug in clustered variance for logistic
    regression. After this fix, integer columns are accepted for binary
    dependent variable using the 'integer to bool' cast rules.
    - Fixed two bugs in SVD:
        - The 'example' option for online help has been fixed
        - Column names for sparse input tables in the 'svd_sparse' and
        'svd_sparse_native' functions are no longer restricted to 'row_id',
        'col_id' and 'value'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MADlib v1.3

Release Date: 2013-October-03

New Features:
* Cox Proportional Hazards:
    - Added stratification support for Cox PH models. Stratification is used as
    shorthand for building a Cox model that allows for more than one stratum,
    and hence, allows for more than one baseline hazard function.
    Stratification provides two pieces of key, flexible functionality for the
    end user of Cox models:
        -- Allows a categorical variable Z to be appropriately accounted for in
        the model without estimating its predictive impact on the response
        variable.
        -- Categorical variable Z is predictive/associated with the response
        variable, but Z may not satisfy the proportional hazards assumption
    - Added a new function (cox_zph) that tests the proportional hazards
    assumption of a Cox model. This allows the user to build Cox models and then
    verify the relevance of the model.
* NULL Handling:
    - Modified behavior of linear and logistic regression to 'omit' rows
    containing NULL values for any of the dependent and independent variables.
    The number of rows skipped is provided as part of the output table.

Deprecated functions:
    - Cox Proportional Hazard function has been renamed to 'coxph_train'.
    Old function names ('cox_prop_hazards' and 'cox_prop_hazards_regr')
    have been deprecated, and will be removed in the next major version update.
    - The aggregate form of linear regression ('linregr') has been deprecated.
    The stored-procedure form ('linregr_train') should be used instead.

Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed a memory leak in the Apriori algorithm.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MADlib v1.2

Release Date: 2013-September-06

New Features:
* ARIMA Timeseries modeling
    - Added auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling for
    non-seasonal, univariate timeseries data.
    - Module includes a training function to compute an ARIMA model and a
    forecasting function to predict future values in the timeseries
    - Training function employs the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) to
    compute a numerical solution for the parameters of the model. The
    observations and innovations for time before the first timestamp
    are assumed to be zero leading to minimization of the conditional sum of
    squares. This produces estimates referred to as conditional maximum likelihood
    estimates (also referred as 'CSS' in some statistical packages).
* Documentation updates:
    - Introduced a new format for documentation improving usability.
    - Upgraded to Doxygen v1.84.
    - Updated documentation improving consistency for multiple modules including
    Regression methods, SVD, PCA, Summary function, and Linear systems.
Bug fixes:
    - Checking out-of-bounds access of a 'svec' even if the size of svec is zero.
    - Fixed a minor bug allowing use of GCC 4.7 and higher to build from source.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MADlib v1.1

Release Date: 2013-August-09

New Features:
* Singular Value Decomposition:
    - Added Singular Value Decomposition using the Lanczos bidiagonalization
    iterative method to decompose the original matrix into PBQ^t, where B is
    a bidiagonalized matrix. We assume that the original matrix is too big to
    load into memory but B can be loaded into the memory. B is then further
    decomposed into XSY^T using Eigen's JacobiSVD function. This restricts the
    number of features in the data matrix to about 5000.
    - This implementation provides SVD (for dense matrix), SVD_BLOCK (also for
    dense matrix but faster), SVD_SPARSE (convert a sparse matrix into a
    dense one, slower) and SVD_SPARSE_NATIVE (directly operate on the sparse
    matrix, much faster for really sparse matrices).

* Principal Component Analysis:
    - Added a PCA training function that generates the top-K principal
    components for an input matrix. The original data is mean-centered by the
    function with the mean matrix returned by the function as a separate table.
    - The module also includes the projection function that projects a test data
    set to the principal components returned by the train function.

* Linear Systems:
    - Added a module to solve linear system of equations (Ax = b).
    - The module utilizes various direct methods from the Eigen library for
    dense systems. Given below is a summary of the methods (more details at
    http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox-devel/group__TutorialLinearAlgebra.html):
        - Householder QR
        - Partial Pivoting LU
        - Full Pivoting LU
        - Column Pivoting Householder QR
        - Full Pivoting Householder QR
        - Standard Cholesky decomposition (LLT)
        - Robust Cholesky decomposition (LDLT)
    - The module also includes direct and iterative methods for sparse linear
    systems:

MADlib v1.0

Release Date: 2013-July-03

New Features:
* Cox Proportional Hazards:
    - Added Right Censoring support for Cox Prop Hazards
* Robust Variance Tests - Huber White:
    - Added a method of calculating robust variance statistic by utilizing the
    Huber-White sandwich estimator for linear regression, logistic regression,
    and multinomial logistic regression
    - Robust variance for linear and logistic regression also includes
    grouping support
* Clustered Sandwich Estimators:
    - Added clustered robust variance statistic by utilizing a clustered sandwich
    estimator for linear regression, logistic regression, and multinomial
    logistic regression
    - Grouping is currently not implemented for clustered and parameter is only
    a placeholder at present
* Marginal Effects Estimator:
    - Added a method for computing the marginal effects for logistic regression
    and multinomial logistic regression
    - Grouping is currently not implemented for marginal effects and the
    parameter is only a placeholder at present
* Multinomial logistic regression:
    - Added a parameter in multinomial logistic regression, to enable picking
    the reference category. Input for number of categories has been removed
    due to redundancy
* Linear regression:
    - Updated grouping columns to input as a comma delimited string rather
    than as an array
    - Resolved an issue with highly collinear data to produce results consistent
    with other statistical packages. Threshold on condition number to use an
    approximation for computing the pseudo-inverse was increased.
* Logistic regression:
    - Changed behavior to error-out if the ouput table already exists

Bug fixes:
* Summary:
    - Summary function (when used with quartiles) used high memory when number
    of column is large. This has been fixed by computing quartiles in an
    iterative manner for a fixed number of columns (Pivotal-170)
    - Fixed a problem with incorrect number of rows returned for Summary when
    all values in a column are NULL (Pivotal-171)

MADlib v0.7

Release Date: 2013-May-01

New Features:
* Correlation function:
    - Function to compute Pearson's cross-correlation for numeric columns in a
        relational table
* Upgrade capability:
    - All new versions since v0.7 are installed in a version-specific folder
        (/usr/local/madlib/Versions/)
    - Upgrade from v0.5/v0.6 to v0.7 on the database is now supported without
        uninstalling previous MADlib database installation.
    - Dependencies on updated functions, types, and other operators are caught
        and upgrade is aborted with an appropriate message

Bug fixes:
* Linear Regression:
    - Improved matrix inversion method to compute coefficients comparable to R
        for regression problems with high multicollinearity (MADLIB-790)
* Logistic Regression:
    - Fixed a problem in logistic regression with grouping on 'text' datatype
        columns  (MADLIB-791)

Known issues:
* Upgrade:
    - Views dependent on MADlib functions being updated will be dropped during
        the upgrade and restored after finishing upgrade. If upgrade fails for
        any reason, these views and the original MADlib schema will *not* be
        restored. Before initiating upgrade, we recommend taking a backup of
        the MADlib schema and move all views dependent on MADlib to separate
        schema and perform a backup with:
                pg_dump -n 'schema_name'

    - Upgrade is currently not supported for the PostgreSQL platform and will
        abort with an error

    - Upgrade currently does not detect functions defined by the user that
        depend upon MADlib functions. Semantic/API changes to these MADlib
        functions could lead to undefined results in such user-defined functions

    - Some important changes for the upgrade from v0.5 to v0.7 are given below
        (Upgrade will raise an error and abort if there exist user-defined views
        that depend on these changes. User-defined functions are not validated
        with this check. An aborted upgrade does not affect the installed version
        of MADlib.)
            -- Logistic regression renamed from 'logregr' to 'logregr_train'
            -- All internal and external aggregates in logistic regression
                have been updated
            -- PLDA module replaced with a refactored LDA module. Due to the
                renaming all functions using PLDA need to be updated
            -- Updated MADlib types:
                    logregr_result, plda_topics_t, plda_word_distrn,
                    plda_word_weight

=================================================
**MADlib<sup>&reg;</sup>** is an open-source library for scalable in-database analytics.
It provides data-parallel implementations of mathematical, statistical and
machine learning methods for structured and unstructured data.

[![Build Status](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Madlib/job/madlib-build/job/madlib2-master/badge/icon)](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Madlib/job/madlib-build/job/madlib2-master/)

Installation and Contribution
==============================
See the project website  [MADlib Home](http://madlib.apache.org/) for links to the
latest binary and source packages.

We appreciate all forms of project contributions to MADlib including bug reports, providing help to new users, documentation, or code patches. Please refer to [Contribution Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MADLIB/Contribution+Guidelines) for instructions.

For more installation and contribution guides,
please refer to the [MADlib Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MADLIB/).

[Compiling from source on Linux](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MADLIB/Installation+Guide#InstallationGuide-CompileFromSourceCompilingFromSource) details are
also on the wiki.


Development with Docker
=======================
We provide a Docker image with necessary dependencies required to compile and test MADlib on PostgreSQL 10.5. You can view the dependency Docker file at ./tool/docker/base/Dockerfile_ubuntu16_postgres10. The image is hosted on Docker Hub at madlib/postgres_10:latest. Later we will provide a similar Docker image for Greenplum Database.

We provide a script to quickly run this docker image at ./tool/docker_start.sh, which will mount your local madlib directory, build MADlib and run install check on this Docker image. At the end, it will `docker exec` as postgres user. Note that you have to run this script from inside your madlib directory, and you can specify your docker CONTAINER_NAME (default is madlib) and IMAGE_TAG (default is latest). Here is an example:

```
CONTAINER_NAME=my_madlib IMAGE_TAG=LaTex ./tool/docker_start.sh
```
Notice that this script only needs to be run once. After that, you will have a local docker container with CONTAINER_NAME running. To get access to the container, run the following command and you can keep working on it.

```
docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME bash
```

To kill this docker container, run:

```
docker kill CONTAINER_NAME
docker rm CONTAINER_NAME
```

You can also manually run those commands to do the same thing:

```
## 1) Pull down the `madlib/postgres_10:latest` image from docker hub:
docker pull madlib/postgres_10:latest

## 2) Launch a container corresponding to the MADlib image, name it
##    madlib, mounting the source code folder to the container:
docker run -d -it --name madlib \
    -v (path to madlib directory):/madlib/ madlib/postgres_10
# where madlib is the directory where the MADlib source code resides.

################################# * WARNING * #################################
# Please be aware that when mounting a volume as shown above, any changes you
# make in the "madlib" folder inside the Docker container will be
# reflected on your local disk (and vice versa). This means that deleting data
# in the mounted volume from a Docker container will delete the data from your
# local disk also.
###############################################################################

## 3) When the container is up, connect to it and build MADlib:
docker exec -it madlib bash
mkdir /madlib/build_docker
cd /madlib/build_docker
cmake ..
make
make doc
make install

## 4) Install MADlib:
src/bin/madpack -p postgres -c postgres/postgres@localhost:5432/postgres install

## 5) Several other commands can now be run, such as:
# Run install check, on all modules:
src/bin/madpack -p postgres -c postgres/postgres@localhost:5432/postgres install-check
# Run install check, on a specific module, say svm:
src/bin/madpack -p postgres -c postgres/postgres@localhost:5432/postgres install-check -t svm
# Reinstall MADlib:
src/bin/madpack -p postgres -c postgres/postgres@localhost:5432/postgres reinstall

## 6) Kill and remove containers (after exiting the container):
docker kill madlib
docker rm madlib
```

Instruction for building design pdf on Docker:

For users who wants to build design pdf, make sure you use the `IMAGE_TAG=LaTex` parameter when running the script. After launching your docker container, run the following to get `design.pdf`:

```
cd /madlib/build_docker
make design_pdf
cd doc/design
```
